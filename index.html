      <p>Greetings and Salutations! My name is Alyssa Templeton, and I am currently in the process of embarking of a career-changing journey. How did I get here, you ask? Let's talk about it.</p>
   <p>You know how there are children out there who know EXACTLY what they want to be when they grow up? Yea, I was not one of those children. When I was little, the most clarity I ever got for a career was at one point, I wanted to be a bat. A flying fox, to be exact. When I finally got old enough to realize that would most likely not happen, I was back to square one. </p>
   <p>The end of high school came and I had to make a decision- I decided on Mechanical Engineering, because I like to make things and know how they work.</p>
   <p>After completing my undergrad, I wound up in industrial sales in various industries: mechanical seals, precast concrete, welding, septic systems, and a brief stint in the quality department of a membrane manufacturing facility. While I enjoyed my jobs, I never felt like any of them were the right fit, and after getting laid off twice from two seperate positions, I decided to end my career in sales.</p>
   <p>So, here I am, embarking on a new career area, praying that my brains will endure Coding Bootcamp long enough to make this decision lucrative and satisfying. Wish me luck and follow my journey as I code myself into a new adventure.</p>
